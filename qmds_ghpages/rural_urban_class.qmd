title: "Urban/Rural Classification and Major Towns and Cities"

## Overview

This section explores the spatial classification of areas as urban or rural, with a particular focus on identifying major towns and cities. By integrating census-based rural-urban classifications with boundaries for built-up areas, we refine the definition of "urban" to better reflect proximity to major population centres. This enhanced classification supports more accurate analysis of health and prescription trends in relation to urbanisation.

## Setup

Required R packages for spatial analysis and data manipulation are installed and loaded.

```{r}
#| label: packages
#| message: false

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
pkgs = c(
  "sf",
  "tidyverse",
  "here",
  "tmap",
  "geojsonsf",
  "rvest"
)

remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
sapply(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Data Acquisition

### Major Towns and Cities Boundaries

Boundaries for major towns and cities are sourced from the ONS Built-up Areas dataset. If not already available locally, the data is downloaded and saved for future use.

```{r}

if (!file.exists("data_raw/towns_boundaries.gpkg")) {
  u <- "https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/Major_Towns_and_Cities_Dec_2015_Boundaries_V2_2022/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson"
  towns_boundaries <- geojsonsf::geojson_sf(u) |>
    st_transform(27700)

  st_write(
    towns_boundaries,
    dsn = file.path(here(), "data_raw", "towns_boundaries.gpkg"),
    append = FALSE
  )
} else {
  towns_boundaries <- st_read(file.path(
    here(),
    "data_raw",
    "towns_boundaries.gpkg"
  ))
}

```

### Census Data: OA Boundaries and Rural-Urban Classification

Output Area (OA) boundaries and the 2021 Rural-Urban classification are obtained from the ONS geoportal. These datasets are joined to assign each OA a rural or urban label.

```{r}
u1 <- "https://github.com/itsleeds/CAZ-health-data-trends/releases/download/v0/Output_Areas_2021_EW_BGC_V2_-5587136561181621407.gpkg"

oa_boundaries_only <- st_read(u1)

u2 <- "https://github.com/itsleeds/CAZ-health-data-trends/releases/download/v0/Rural_Urban_Classification_.2021._of_Output_Areas_in_EW.csv"

oa_classification <- read_csv(
  u2,
  col_types = cols(
    OA21CD = col_character(),
    RUC21CD = col_character(),
    RUC21NM = col_character(),
    Urban_rural_flag = col_character(),
    ObjectId = col_double()
  )
)


oa_boundaries <- oa_boundaries_only |>
  left_join(oa_classification, by = join_by(OA21CD))

```

## Data Exploration

We visualise the rural-urban classification from the 2021 census, overlaying the locations of major towns and cities to highlight spatial patterns.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(oa_boundaries) +
  tm_fill("RUC21NM") +
  tm_shape(towns_boundaries) +
  tm_borders("grey80")
```


## Spatial Analysis

To refine the urban classification, we identify OAs that fall within major towns or cities. These areas are reclassified as "Urban: within major town or city" to distinguish them from other urban or rural locations.

```{r}
id_town <- st_within(oa_boundaries, towns_boundaries)

oa_boundaries$id_town <- vapply(
  id_town,
  \(x) {
    if (length(x) == 1) {
      x
    } else {
      NA_integer_
    }
  },
  numeric(1)
)

```

## Results

A new variable, `RUC21NM_adj`, is created to reflect the adjusted urban/rural classification. The results are visualised and saved for further analysis.

```{r}
oa_boundaries$RUC21NM_adj <- oa_boundaries$RUC21NM
oa_boundaries$RUC21NM_adj[
  !is.na(oa_boundaries$id_town)
] <- "Urban: within major town or city"
```

Visualising the results

```{r}
#| label: final-class-map
tm_shape(oa_boundaries) +
  tm_fill("RUC21NM_adj") +
  tm_shape(towns_boundaries) +
  tm_borders()
```

Saving results for OA classification

```{r}
st_write(
  oa_boundaries,
  file.path("data_raw", "oa_classified.gpkg"),
  append = FALSE
)
```

## Practice Location Classification

GP practice locations are loaded and spatially joined to the OA boundaries. Each practice is assigned the adjusted urban/rural classification based on its location.

```{r}
pract_CAZclassed <- st_read("data_raw/CAZ_practices.gpkg")
```

Extracting the indexes of the OA where the practices are:
```{r}
pract_location_oa <- st_within(
  pract_CAZclassed,
  oa_boundaries
) |>
  unlist()

## A simple check
# identical(nrow(pract_CAZclassed),length(pract_location_oa))

```

Bringing the urban classification using the indexes

```{r}
pract_CAZclassed$RUC21NM_adj <- oa_boundaries$RUC21NM_adj[pract_location_oa]
```

The results are visualised and saved for use in further health data analysis.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(pract_CAZclassed) +
  tm_dots("RUC21NM_adj")
```

Saving the results
```{r}
st_write(
  pract_CAZclassed,
  "data_raw/CAZ_practices_urban_rural.gpkg",
  append = FALSE
)
```
