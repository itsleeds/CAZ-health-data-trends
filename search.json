    "text": "This section focuses on acquiring and processing data about General Practice (GP) surgeries across England. GP practices serve as the primary point of contact for patients in the NHS system and are therefore crucial for understanding healthcare utilisation patterns in different geographic areas.\nFor the CAZ health analysis, GP practice data serves several important purposes:\n\nSpatial reference points: Practice locations help link health data to specific geographic areas, allowing us to determine which practices serve populations within or near Clean Air Zones\nDenominator data: Patient registration numbers provide the population base needed to calculate prescription rates and health indicator ratios\nGeographic stratification: Practices can be classified by their proximity to CAZ boundaries to compare health outcomes across different exposure levels\n\nThe analysis uses data from OpenPrescribing.net, which provides comprehensive information about NHS prescribing patterns and practice characteristics. This includes practice locations, patient registration numbers, and prescribing volumes, all of which are essential for our spatial health analysis.\nBy mapping GP practices in relation to CAZ boundaries, we can create meaningful comparison groups for evaluating the health impacts of air quality interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading required packages for spatial analysis and web scraping.\n\n\nShow the code\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\nif (!require(\"remotes\")) {\n  install.packages(\"remotes\")\n}\npkgs = c(\n  \"sf\",\n  \"tidyverse\",\n  \"here\",\n  \"tmap\",\n  \"geojsonsf\",\n  \"rvest\"\n)\n\nremotes::install_cran(pkgs)\nsapply(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\n\n       sf tidyverse      here      tmap geojsonsf     rvest \n     TRUE      TRUE      TRUE      TRUE      TRUE      TRUE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading Sub-ICB (Clinical Commissioning Group) boundary data from OpenPrescribing.\n\n\nShow the code\nif (!file.exists(\"data_raw/subicb_boundaries.gpkg\")) {\n  u &lt;- \"https://openprescribing.net/api/1.0/org_location/?org_type=ccg\"\n  subicb_boundaries &lt;- geojsonsf::geojson_sf(u) |&gt;\n    st_transform(27700)\n\n  st_write(\n    subicb_boundaries,\n    dsn = file.path(here(), \"data_raw\", \"subicb_boundaries.gpkg\"),\n    append = FALSE\n  )\n} else {\n  subicb_boundaries &lt;- st_read(file.path(\n    here(),\n    \"data_raw\",\n    \"subicb_boundaries.gpkg\"\n  ))\n}\n\n\nReading layer `subicb_boundaries' from data source \n  `C:\\temp_jf\\CAZ-health-data-trends\\data_raw\\subicb_boundaries.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 106 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 87318.43 ymin: 7053.782 xmax: 655646.4 ymax: 657547.7\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining the location of GP practices from OpenPrescribing for each Sub-ICB\nDownloading GP practice locations for each Sub-ICB area from the OpenPrescribing API.\n\n\nShow the code\nif (!file.exists(\"data_raw/gp_locations.gpkg\")) {\n  all_practices &lt;- lapply(subicb_boundaries$code, \\(t_code) {\n    geojsonsf::geojson_sf(\n      paste0(\"https://openprescribing.net/api/1.0/org_location/?q=\", t_code)\n    ) |&gt;\n      st_transform(27700) |&gt;\n      mutate(par_code = t_code)\n  }) |&gt;\n    bind_rows()\n\n  st_write(\n    all_practices,\n    dsn = file.path(here(), \"data_raw\", \"gp_locations.gpkg\"),\n    append = FALSE\n  )\n} else {\n  all_practices &lt;- st_read(file.path(here(), \"data_raw\", \"gp_locations.gpkg\"))\n}\n\n\nReading layer `gp_locations' from data source \n  `C:\\temp_jf\\CAZ-health-data-trends\\data_raw\\gp_locations.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 11968 features and 4 fields (with 7 geometries empty)\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 90774 ymin: 10282 xmax: 655043 ymax: 653236\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading previously created CAZ buffer zones for spatial analysis.\n\n\nShow the code\ncaz_buffers &lt;- st_read(file.path(here(), \"data_raw\", \"CAZ_buffers.gpkg\"))\n\n\nReading layer `CAZ_buffers' from data source \n  `C:\\temp_jf\\CAZ-health-data-trends\\data_raw\\CAZ_buffers.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 35 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 346347.5 ymin: 89474.96 xmax: 475150.8 ymax: 575397.8\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\nIdentifying GP practices located within CAZ buffer zones.\n\n\nShow the code\ncaz_practices &lt;- all_practices[caz_buffers, ]\n\n\nClassifying practices by their distance from CAZ boundaries and assigning CAZ names.\n\n\nShow the code\npractices_intersects &lt;- st_intersects(caz_practices, caz_buffers)\n\ncaz_practices$buffer_km &lt;- vapply(\n  practices_intersects,\n  \\(caz_index) {\n    caz_buffers$buffer_km[caz_index] |&gt;
